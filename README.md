# RenameToGuid
A simple console application meant to rename a file or all files in a directory to random Guids.

The purpose is to avoid name conflicts for things like pictures, when the actual names aren't relevant but the names need to be unique. 

# Useage:
RenameToGuid.exe FileName
RenameToGuid.exe DirectoryName

Or, just run AddToRegistry.ps1 to add the application to the context menu for all files and directories.
